Tasks and Graders for College Admission Counselling Environment.

3 Tasks with increasing difficulty:
    Task 1 (Easy)   - Simple seat acceptance, clear path, 6 steps max
    Task 2 (Medium) - Strategic upgrade across 2 rounds, 10 steps max
    Task 3 (Hard)   - Multi-round counselling with tight deadlines, 15 steps max

Graders return float 0.0 -> 1.0:
    0.0  = completely failed (withdrew or missed deadline with nothing done)
    0.5  = partial success (got a seat but not the optimal one)
    1.0  = perfect (best possible college in correct sequence)

All graders are DETERMINISTIC — same actions always produce same score.
